# Performance Optimization

<span className="version-badge">v18.0.1.0.4</span>

The BJET API Synchronization Module includes several performance optimization features to ensure efficient operation.

## Pagination Support

The module provides pagination capabilities for handling large datasets:

- **Configurable record limits per request** - Set the maximum number of records to process at once
- **Automatic pagination for large datasets** - Automatically splits large data sets into manageable chunks
- **Memory-efficient data processing** - Reduces memory consumption by processing data in batches

## Batch Processing

Optimize API operations by processing multiple records together:

- **Handle multiple records in a single API call** - Reduce the number of API requests
- **Optimized database queries** - Efficient data retrieval from Odoo
- **Reduced network overhead** - Minimize network traffic and latency

## Timeout Management

Configure timeouts to optimize connection handling:

- **Connection Timeout**: Maximum time allowed to establish an API connection (default: 5 seconds)
- **Read Timeout**: Maximum time allowed to wait for response data (default: 15 seconds)
- **Configurable per API**: Individual timeout settings can be defined for different APIs

## Best Practices

To optimize performance when using the API Synchronization Module:

1. **Use appropriate batch sizes** - Configure batch sizes based on your data volume and API limitations
2. **Apply efficient domain filters** - Filter records at the database level to reduce processing
3. **Monitor API rate limits** - Respect external API rate limits to avoid throttling
4. **Cache frequently accessed data** - Leverage the built-in caching mechanisms

## Common Performance Issues and Solutions

### Timeout Errors
- **Solution**: Increase connection or read timeout values in the configuration
- Check network connectivity and external API performance

### Memory Issues with Large Datasets
- **Solution**: Enable pagination and reduce batch size
- Process records in smaller chunks

### Slow Synchronization
- **Solution**: Optimize domain filters to reduce the number of records
- Use batch processing to reduce API calls
- Verify external API response times
